Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================
## Approach

* This bowling scorecard was written in Ruby, in a test driven manner using RSpec.
* I allocated most of my time to planning (~50 mins), my plan was iterated 3 times, the most recent is below!  
* I calculated the scores for the RSpec using an online bowling score calculater. 
* A decent bulk of this challenge was figuring out how to attach a picture to the readme! 

## Planning

* I roughly planned this out in a notepad, as shown below!

## Method

* I broke it down into 1 main method, add_roll() and stored: bonus, total, frame, and current_frame in instance variables.

## Results

* It's a fully functioning scorecard (from the back-end perspective).
* All tests are passing (100% coverage)
* Code was linted according to rubocop
