Hello! :)
No instructions here, just codezilla.rb, which contains a big, monstrous 'if' statement which I tested on some arrays I commented out, and compared against a bowling score website.

Codezilla "seems to work" on the various arrays I fed it, which represent bowling cards. Last week was stressful, so I may (or may not) refactor the core logic into something nice.

( •_•) sorry if you're getting the raw version.
