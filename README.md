## Steps
### Stage 1 - Prep
1. Created CRC cards and flow chart (accesible in docs - previews attached later in Readme) 
2. Created Gemfile. Minimal gem usage - gems targeted for improving code/test quality. RSpec framework installed.
### Stage 2 - Score class
3. Created score spec. Expected that it can receive a numberic roll
4. Created score.rb that accepts numeric roll. Currently just returns it (commit 1).
5. Create distinct tests and score for second roll. Changed name of original roll method to reflect second roll (commit 2). 
6. Created test for score object to init with two roll totals (init to nil) and spare/strike (init to false) (commit 3).
7. Created test for scoring 10 pins in one roll to set strike to true. Added if statement to set strike to true when first_roll ==10.
8. Created test for scoring 10 pins in two rolls to set spare to true. Added if statement to set spare to true when first roll + second roll == 10 (commit 4).
9. REFACTOR. To satisfy SRP within the score class, I created distinct methods for spare/strike logic. Test 1 refactored to check instance var first_roll as opposed to pins being returned by method (commit 5).
### Stage 3 - Frame class
11. Created frame spec. Expect it to have a score and frame number as default.
12. Created frame.rb. Inits taking a round as an init arg, and inits with a score.
13. Created tests that pass rolls to frame, and expect it to change score accordingly
14. Created frame methods that pass rolls to score (commit 6).
### Stage 4 - Game class
15. Created game class spec with empty test.
16. Created game class to satisft empty test.
17. Added test that checks game class initis with current frame (nil expectation) and all frames (empty array expectation).
18. Added instance variables to game class, enabling it to pass step 17. tests (commit 7).
19. Realised that class couldn't meet all responsbilities laid out in CRC cards. Added round num var tests, and tests that against changed name of current round to better reflect what that var returns.
20.  Updated game class to past new tests (with new var names) (commit 8).
21. Created test that checks frame num starts at 1. Created a start_game method that creates a Frame object with round = 1, and sets it to current_frame.
22. REFACTOR: Game spec growing quickly, so split out init tests to nested describe block. 
23. Created test that checks end_frame creates a new frame obj that is distinct from old one, pushes old one into array of old frames, and changes frame num. Created relevant method (commit 9).
24. Created test that checks user input. Created test that rolls a non-strike, then stores the old frame with a completed score in array.
25. Created methods for above. Created stub that mocks a roll of a non strike across two rolls to pass tests (commit 10).
26. Created a test that expects game end message after 10 frames. Created end game method, which is called during end frame if frame num == 10 (commit 11). 
27. Notice edge case where start_game could be called multiple times, changing frame obj and scores but keeping prior num. Corrected.
28. Created a test that made two rolls (non-strike) and expected game to know the score. Created game method that looks at array of past frames, and uses the inbuilt frame method to calculate total score and plot on a game instance var (commit 12).
29. Added additional messaging output to signpost end of frame to user (commit 13).
30. REFACTOR: Created 3 new methods to create smalller methods in game class (due to SRP) (commit 14).
### Stage 5 - Sparing and Striking out - returning to Frame & Score
31. Changed the name of calculate_score in Score to calculate_normal_score in anticipation of alternative ways of calculating scores. Created calculate_strike_score and calculate_spare_score (empty methods).
32. Created a helper method for rolling a spare, and a helper method for rolling a strike.
33. Created a game test where it expects game to pass to Frame whether the last round was a strike.
34. Changed scoring to know whether previous round was a strike using index.
35. Changed scoring to know whether previous round was a spare.
36. Changed scoring to add bonus for spare.
37. Changed scoring to add bonus for strike.
### Stage 6 - PANIC at the bowling alley! Big refactor
38. Realised that strike and spare bonuses should be added to PRIOR rounds, meaning my current method of adding bonus to round score was incorrect. Would have to add it to prior score - though would need an overhaul of scoring to allow for this, as frame scores weren't exposed. 
39. Fixed tests for scoring in game spec, by changing numbers to expect right amounts - and changed their expect subject to track the previous roll scores in the old scores array (commit 15)
40. Changed logic to target new scoring mechanism - added a conditional to scoring total, where if the prior round was a spare, the current round would go back into the array of past scores and edit using first roll (commit 16).
41. Copied strike to logic to spares with a few tweaks. Strike works with full functionality (commit 17).
### Stage 7 - Being really good at Bowling - last round strikes and spares
42. Created a test that played out 10 rounds - scoring a spare on the 10th round. Test expects game to be ongoing if 10th round is spare.
43. Created a separate final frame method for distinct scoring methods to live in ('final frame'). Everything working!
44. Uploaded miro and CRC cards to images. 



Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday week

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD PROGRAM. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player. For this challenge, you do _not_ need to build a web app with a UI, instead, just focus on the logic for bowling (you also don't need a database). Next end-of-unit challenge, you will have the chance to translate the logic to Javascript and build a user interface.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

As usual please start by

* Forking this repo

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday week at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday week at 9am. 

___STRONG HINT, IGNORE AT YOUR PERIL:___ Bowling is a deceptively complex game. Careful thought and thorough diagramming — both before and throughout — will save you literal hours of your life.

## Focus for this challenge
The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code.

In order to do this, you may pay particular attention to the following:
* Using diagramming to plan your approach to the challenge
* TDD your code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Commit often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code

## Bowling — how does it work?

### Strikes

The player has a strike if he knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame. The frame ends immediately (since there are no pins left for a second roll). The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls. That would be the next frame, unless the player rolls another strike.

### Spares

The player has a spare if the knocks down all 10 pins with the two rolls of a frame. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first roll of next frame).

### 10th frame

If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus. But they can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame. The additional rolls only count for the bonus not for the regular frame count.

    10, 10, 10 in the 10th frame gives 30 points (10 points for the regular first strike and 20 points for the bonus).
    1, 9, 10 in the 10th frame gives 20 points (10 points for the regular spare and 10 points for the bonus).

### Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

### Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.
