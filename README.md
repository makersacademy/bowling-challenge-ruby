Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================

* This is the weekend challenge for week 5 of Makers Academy. All weekend challenges are meant to be completed
* This is the logic written for a bowling scorecard. This project was written in Ruby and is meant to be translated to a different language on a futre challenge.
* The project doesn't have an interface just yet, but you can interact with it by running IRB.

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD PROGRAM**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player. For this challenge, you do _not_ need to build a web app with a UI, instead, just focus on the logic for bowling (you also don't need a database). Next end-of-unit challenge, you will have the chance to translate the logic to Javascript and build a user interface.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

## Focus for this challenge
The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code.

In order to do this, you may pay particular attention to the following:
* Using diagramming to plan your approach to the challenge
* TDD your code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Commit often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code
