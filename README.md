* Would like to work on making tests be more on behaviour rather than state - if had more time, would change a lot of '.to eq' to '.to change' in rspec
* If had more time, would like to refactor to extract a 'frame' class that handles individual frame scores, checking if a frame is a strike or a spare, etc.
