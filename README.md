Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================
William's attempt at Bowling Challenge.

My plan here is to ask the user for input for the first bowl, and the second bowl of each frame, and then output a scorecard up to that point. It appears the biggest problem here is deciding exactly how many classes to use. Part of me thinks the whole thing could be thrown into a single long and complicated class. But breaking it down perhaps each frame should be its own object class, the rolling score and how it is calculated could also be it's own seperate class. And then a third class for the actual scoring input/output and interactive menu. Perhaps I am overcomplicating it here, perhaps not, we shall see.

My first target will be what I feel the easiest entry point, and that is at the Frame class, setting up whilst considering the 10th frame and it's potential 3 bowls. After some deliberation I decided not to go with a third class, and overcomplicating it, and going with two, Frame and Score. I am very happy at how the Frame is set up, and I am also happy with how it is built using the user input.

All the groundwork seems in place to now just delve into the very annoying maths/algebra behind the score formula. The hard part here is essentially having to account for values you don't actually know yet. Finally it seems like I more or less have it. I have stopped writing tests as I am running out of time, and no idea how to test for gets.chomp anyway and would rather spend what little time I have left actually trying to crack the code.

Due to the absence of tests I have been using IRB extensively to test everything. The code works, but the score for some reason doesn't, even though it reads correct to me. It almost feels like the code I am written is being ignored at this point, as it clearly says if the frame is a spare or strike score 0, yet it scores 15. And after a test then decided to some how deduct score from one round to the next, even though there is absolutely no subtractions or deletes anywhere in the method, I decided it was time to call it a night as once again it's 1am on a Monday night, and my brain is far too switched off and relaxed from a much needed long weekend to deal with this any further.

Conclusion, felt extremely close, what I have written I have re read many times and still feel it should work, and cannot see any reason to suggest why it doesn't. But spoiler: it doesn't.

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday week

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD PROGRAM. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player. For this challenge, you do _not_ need to build a web app with a UI, instead, just focus on the logic for bowling (you also don't need a database). Next end-of-unit challenge, you will have the chance to translate the logic to Javascript and build a user interface.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

As usual please start by

* Forking this repo

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday week at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday week at 9am. 

___STRONG HINT, IGNORE AT YOUR PERIL:___ Bowling is a deceptively complex game. Careful thought and thorough diagramming — both before and throughout — will save you literal hours of your life.

## Focus for this challenge
The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code.

In order to do this, you may pay particular attention to the following:
* Using diagramming to plan your approach to the challenge
* TDD your code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Commit often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code

## Bowling — how does it work?

### Strikes

The player has a strike if he knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame. The frame ends immediately (since there are no pins left for a second roll). The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls. That would be the next frame, unless the player rolls another strike.

### Spares

The player has a spare if the knocks down all 10 pins with the two rolls of a frame. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first roll of next frame).

### 10th frame

If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus. But they can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame. The additional rolls only count for the bonus not for the regular frame count.

    10, 10, 10 in the 10th frame gives 30 points (10 points for the regular first strike and 20 points for the bonus).
    1, 9, 10 in the 10th frame gives 20 points (10 points for the regular spare and 10 points for the bonus).

### Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

### Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.
