Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD PROGRAM. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player. For this challenge, you do _not_ need to build a web app with a UI, instead, just focus on the logic for bowling (you also don't need a database). Next end-of-unit challenge, you will have the chance to translate the logic to Javascript and build a user interface.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset. 

___STRONG HINT, IGNORE AT YOUR PERIL:___ Bowling is a deceptively complex game. Careful thought and thorough diagramming — both before and throughout — will save you literal hours of your life.

## Focus for this challenge
The focus for this challenge is to write high-quality code.

In order to do this, you may pay particular attention to the following:
* Using diagramming to plan your approach to the challenge
* TDD your code
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Commit often, with good commit messages
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code

## How to use

1. Clone this repo - https://github.com/Cloudy1986/bowling-challenge-ruby
2. Navigate to the repo in your terminal and run `bundle install`
3. To see the test results run `rspec`
4. To see an example, run `ruby app.rb`
5. To see total score for a new game, update `GAME` in `app.rb` with new scores and run `ruby app.rb`

## Notes
I wasn't feeling very well this weekend so I relied heavily on another students code rather than not complete the challenge - https://github.com/hamstercat007/bowling-challenge-ruby. My reasoning is that next week's weekend challenge is dependent on completing this weekend's challenge so it was important to have something ready for next weekend.
