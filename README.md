Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================
## Completed whilst keeping in mind
* TDD
* Focus on testing behaviour rather than state
* Single Responsibility Principle and encapsulation
* Clear and readable code



## The Game class

* The Game class gets instantiated either at the begining of the game or at any stage within the game, loading(initialize) the state of the game(name of the player, pins left standing, frame number, roll number, current score, number of future rolls with bonus).
* **The currents state of the game** gets checked and tested for invalid values and then the game continues registering new rolls, moving forward  with the frames or ending the game if the conditions are met.
* The Game class does not need to be aware of the whole game but only the current state in order to continue **the pins registration** and complete the game.
* The current state of the game can be stored in a database(recomended) or in a session.

## Model and Unit testing

* The Game class has 25 methods explicitly named to declare their behavior/funtionality.
* 25 unit tests, testing for edge cases and behavior/functionality in one of the each: Perfect/Gutter/Normal game.
* The testing coverage is 100%.

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD PROGRAM. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player. For this challenge, you do _not_ need to build a web app with a UI, instead, just focus on the logic for bowling (you also don't need a database). Next end-of-unit challenge, you will have the chance to translate the logic to Javascript and build a user interface.

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

As usual please start by

___STRONG HINT, IGNORE AT YOUR PERIL:___ Bowling is a deceptively complex game. Careful thought and thorough diagramming — both before and throughout — will save you literal hours of your life.

## Bowling — how does it work?

### Strikes

The player has a strike if he knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll in a frame. The frame ends immediately (since there are no pins left for a second roll). The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls. That would be the next frame, unless the player rolls another strike.

### Spares

The player has a spare if the knocks down all 10 pins with the two rolls of a frame. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first roll of next frame).

### 10th frame

If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame they can roll the additional balls for the bonus. But they can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame. The additional rolls only count for the bonus not for the regular frame count.

    10, 10, 10 in the 10th frame gives 30 points (10 points for the regular first strike and 20 points for the bonus).
    1, 9, 10 in the 10th frame gives 20 points (10 points for the regular spare and 10 points for the bonus).

### Gutter Game

A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores).

### Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.
