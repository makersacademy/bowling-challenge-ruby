Bowling Challenge in Ruby
=================

## Outline

This is a ruby program which handles the calculation of a bowling game for one player. It is based on regular bowling rules and is designed to find the running total after each frame is played (to be inputted by the user).

In my tests, when refering to a 'simple frame', I mean a frame in which the player has not rolled a spare or a strike.
