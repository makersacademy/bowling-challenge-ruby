# Bowling Challenge

## Description

I opted to create two separate classes: one for each frame of the game called `Frame` and another one for the entirity of the game called `BowlingGame`.

The `Frame` class contains two different instance variables for each roll. Moreover, it will also have another variable, that will store the total points of the frame. This will be set as an attr_accessor so the `BowlingGame` is able to add to it if any strikes or spares were made.
