Reflecting on this challenge:
------------------------------------------------------------
- I attempted to implement two classes working together. One for game and one for frame. After some issues with this, I  realised that all could capture all the methods within one class. Perhaps when/if this project were to be expanded, then I would separate accordingly.

- I attempted to use '/' for spares and 'X's for strikes, however this proved too problematic and so instead just added the 10 points for each in their place. An actual bowling scorecard would not include this 10 until the next turn is taken, so it is a feature that I would definitely like to amend in the future.

- I've tested against most edge cases. One which I wasn't able to solve unfortunately was rolling a double 0 in the first frame. The score is added accurately, however, the user will not receive a 'Double Gutter' message like he/she would if they rolled it at any other point throughout the game.

- A clear positive for me in this task was the disciplined use of TDD. Felt very in control for the most part using this process.
