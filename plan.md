It's about a logic not necessarily a nice UI.


## Rules 

10 Frames
1 or 2 rolls
Score is knocked down pins + bonus

### Bonus 

- Strikes

All 10 knocked down. 
No more rolls for that frame
Bonus is the number of pins knocked down on next 2 rolls. (This would be the total of the next frame unless another strike is rolled)

- Spare

Knocks down 10 pins on 2nd roll in a frame.
Bonus is number of pins knocked down on next roll.

### 10th Frame

- Max 3 rolls
- 10, 10, 10 gives 30 points. 
- 1, 9, 10 gives 20 points.

## How I will tackle this problem

1. Create a game which assumes no split or strike. Just 10 frames, frame ends if you knock 10 over. This allows for a max score of 100.

2. Introduce a split bonus. Bonus is the next roll.
