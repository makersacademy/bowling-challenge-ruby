Bowling Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

2. Design the Class System
Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com


Also design the interface of each class in more detail.

class Frame
  def initialize(number, io)
    # number is an integer

  end

  def print_number
    # prints frame number
  end
end
class Roll
  def initialize(number, io)
  end

  def print_number
    # prints frame number
  end

  def ask_for_pins
    # makes a puts
  end

  def get_pins
    # asks for input
  end
end

class Game
  def initialize
  end

  def run_game
    # runs the game
  end
end

class Frame10
  def initialize
    # child of Frame
  end
end

class Score
  def initialize(score)
    # score is an int
  end
  def calculate_score
  end
  def print_score
  end
end



3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.

# EXAMPLE

# Gets all tracks
library = MusicLibrary.new
track_1 = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track.new("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.all # => [track_1, track_2]
4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail.

# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

5. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
