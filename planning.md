- Frame 1-9 are the same? Definitely 2-8.
- Frames 1-9: Max number of pins per frame = 10
- Frame 10 may need extra roll.
- Rolls need to be passed in by player -- but as just integers, or strings too?
- Score needs to be stored and can be altered when the scores for the next frame are passed in.
- Frame needs to go up every two rolls unless the first roll is a strike.
- Accumulator for score and for frame.
- Input for a roll is one (10) or two arguments.
Edge cases e/g/ can't input 12 etc. How will user inptu

#### How to store points...
1. Separate hashes with arrays for rolls and total score.
  - but how do I amend the final score.
2. Array of hashes
3. Array where no separation between frames
4. Array of arrays

Score = [{'Frame 1' => [roll1, roll2, score]} ]

score = [[1, 3, 4], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
bonus = [0, 1, 2, 3, ]

** probably easier to work with an array to add scores **
** How can I tell which frame I am on? **

Or instead of rolls, have strike => false, spare => true
* Iain's complete or not complete bonus
* number of bonus balls, when it gets to zero, closed

#### Order of game...

Takes input of rolls with variable args. (...test with double/mocking...?) (roll1, roll2 = nil)
Each time a roll/pair of rolls is added, +1 frame.
Loop until frame = 10...

###### frame = 1 or 10
add points to current frame.

###### frame = 2-8
If the previous frame's (use indexes on arrays) first index = 10, add both numbers from rolls to previous total.
If the previous frame's first two indexes = 10, add the first roll number to previous total.
Add points to current frame.

###### frame 10
add points to current frame.
