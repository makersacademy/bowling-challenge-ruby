# DO NOT TEST STATE - The only behaviour of the code is that it caclulate the correct score. That's what needs teting.
#  Write one test that test that different inputs caclulate the correct score.
#  Following TDD would mean that the first test is taking one roll and the score is that roll's pins.
#  Then add one roll and the score will be the sum of the two rolls' pins... etc
