## How to Use

Clone this repository, bundle install, open irb, create a new game object (e.g. game = Game.new), then record your rolls using the roll method on your game object, with the number of pins knocked down being the parameter accepted by the roll method (e.g. game.roll(10))

## My Thoughts

The only good thing I can say is that it works (as far as I have tested in IRB), and I did it all myself. I mentally planned during the weekend how to do this, but left it too late to actually put pen to paper on a diagram, or some coding. The end result is a mess that violates all sorts of coding principles.

I like my 'transfer' method, for tackling the bonus - that's probably the one thing I'm proud of. I figured the bonus would take a lot of time to implement but actually it was really quick. What f***ed me over was the final rack permutations.

There's lots for me to improve, and I'm not satisfied with my workflow or process. But being honest, there is satisfaction in getting it done - as Malcolm X would say - by any means necessary.
