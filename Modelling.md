Modelling bowling score card:

Methods:

Game
Round
Last Round
Score

Game calls round and then score until the last round, where it initiates a special method for final score
Score stores the latest input, and keeps a running total

Scores are stored in an array of arrays. 

This can also be done with classes but to start off I just want to use methods because that's a lot easier!
