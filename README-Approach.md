Approach to solving challenge
======

1. Create an initial user story to extract client's requirements.
2. Use these requirements to write the first set of feature tests (which should fail).
3. Write a series of unit tests based on the client's requirements to ensure that all feature tests pass. 
4. Refactor the code and ensure it conforms to the Rubocop style guide and SRP. 
5. Submit a pull request.
