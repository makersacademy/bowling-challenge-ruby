As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my score while playing a game of bowling. When I start the program, I want to be prompted to enter the number of pins I knocked down on each throw of each frame, and I want the program to calculate my score and display it on a scorecard.

If I knock down all ten pins on my first throw of a frame, I want the program to automatically record a strike and move on to the next frame. If I knock down all ten pins on the second throw of a frame, I want the program to record a spare and move on to the next frame.

If I do not knock down all ten pins on a frame, I want the program to record an open frame and move on to the next frame.

When I reach the 10th frame, I want the program to allow me to make up to three throws if necessary, and to correctly calculate my score based on the number of pins knocked down in each throw.

At the end of the game, I want the program to display my total score and ask me if I want to start a new game or exit the program.
