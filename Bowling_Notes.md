## Bowling rules

- Knock down all pins
Player has 2 tries per round(frame)
If the player hits 3 down on 1st try then gets those points
Also gets the points from the second round
However if it is a spare then gets the points of the next roundâ€™s 1st try
Eg 
   . Round 1 try 1 player gets 3 and then gets the remaining 7 on try 2 it counts as a 10
   . Then if they get 4 for round 2 try 1 it gets added to the previous score. That means the total score is 13
This also changes if a player gets a strike
A strike means a definite 10 points plus whatever points from the next round added together. Unless it is another strike
Eg 
   . If after round 3 the score is 13 and they get a strike round 4 and round 5 the player gets 2 try 1 and 4 try 2 then in total the score is 29
For the 10th round(frame) the player has 2 trys like usual unless they get a strike or spare. There is then the option for a 3rd try. However never more than 3 triesfor a 10th round.
