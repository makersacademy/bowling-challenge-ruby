To run Bowling Game:
1. Open Terminal
2. enter irb
3. require './playground_aka_feature_test.rb'
4. create new game - for example game = Game.new
5. to roll a ball - game.roll(pins_knocked_down) for example game.roll(4)
6. to find out current score - game.current_score

Unfortunately Jesus Quintana wouldn't be happy with my scorecard as all his strikes wont get extra points.
